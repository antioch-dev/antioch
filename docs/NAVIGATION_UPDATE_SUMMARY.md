# Fellowship Navigation Update - Summary

## What Changed?

The fellowship-level navigation (`/[fellowship_id]/*`) has been completely redesigned to provide a better user experience with cleaner organization and easier navigation between apps.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Organized App Switcher**
- All 13+ fellowship apps are now organized into 4 categories
- Easy-to-browse modal with search functionality
- Visual cards with icons and descriptions
- Current app is highlighted

### 2. **Breadcrumb Navigation**
- Always know where you are in the fellowship site
- Auto-generated from the URL
- Shows path from fellowship home to current page

### 3. **Cleaner Top Bar**
- Fellowship branding with icon and name
- Current app indicator (desktop)
- Quick access to app switcher, theme toggle, and user menu
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## For Developers

### Adding a New App

To add a new app to the navigation system:

1. Open `src/config/fellowship-apps.ts`
2. Add your app to the array:

```typescript
{
  id: "my-app",
  name: "My App",
  description: "What your app does",
  href: `/${fellowshipId}/my-app`,
  icon: MyIcon, // Import from lucide-react
  category: "ministry", // or "management", "communication", "analytics"
  color: "bg-blue-500", // Tailwind color class
}
```

3. The app automatically appears in:
   - App switcher modal
   - Mobile menu
   - Breadcrumbs (when navigating to it)

### Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── fellowship-navigation.tsx     # Main navigation component
├── config/
│   └── fellowship-apps.ts            # App registry
└── app/
    └── [fellowship_id]/
        └── layout.tsx                # Uses FellowshipNavigation
```

## User Experience

### Desktop View
- Top navigation bar with all controls visible
- App switcher opens as centered modal
- Breadcrumbs below the main bar
- Current app shown next to fellowship name

### Mobile View
- Hamburger menu button
- Side drawer with categorized app list
- All features accessible
- Responsive breadcrumbs

## App Categories

**Ministry** - Core spiritual activities
- Bible, Bible Study, Prayer, Worship Music, Evangelism

**Management** - Administrative tools
- Forms, Task Manager, Leadership, Finance

**Communication** - Engagement tools
- Polling, Q&A, Feedback

**Analytics** - Data and insights

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to existing apps
- Apps with their own sub-navigation (like Bible) work seamlessly
- The fellowship layout automatically wraps all child routes
- Existing Header/Footer removed from fellowship layout

## Testing Recommendations

1. Navigate to any fellowship app: `/{fellowship_id}/bible`
2. Click the grid icon to open app switcher
3. Try searching for an app
4. Check breadcrumbs update as you navigate
5. Test on mobile devices (hamburger menu)
6. Try theme switching (light/dark)
